- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

 ```cd NativeHackerApp```
3. Install dependencies <br>

### Additional Notes
Ensure both your phone and laptop are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.<br>
Like React.js, real-time updates are enabled. Any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the app.<br>
You can also run a web version or an emulator. Refer to the terminal output for available options.
