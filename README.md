### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository:<br>
```git clone "https://github.com/Unknown-Blaze/BrainHacks-Code-Exp.git"```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:<br>
 ```cd NativeHackerApp```
3. Install dependencies <br>
```npm install```
4. Make sure expo is installed by running:
```npm expo -v``` 
and checking if some version (in my case 10.2.3) is there.<br>
5. Go to your app store and download the Expo Go app on your phone.
6. Create an Expo account.
7. Start the Development Server:<br>
```npx expo start```
8. Scan the QR code on your phone with the Expo Go app.
9. If anything doesn't work, ask ChatGPT, check expo docs or msg in group. If none work. Pray to God and try again üëç

### Additional Notes
Ensure both your phone and laptop are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.<br>
Like React.js, real-time updates are enabled. Any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the app.<br>
You can also run a web version or an emulator. Refer to the terminal output for available options.
